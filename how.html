  <section id="intro">
    <p>Hello, here I am again! I want to share with you my great joy.....<b> Against all odds I managed to relieve relieve these horrible joints pains
and hateful arthritis</b> on my hands at home in just three weeks .</p>

    <p>Remenber about a year ago when i wrote about how, despite my exercising joints and constantly trying to improve their condition,my joint kept hurting and those horrible bumps on my hands kept getting bigger and bigger ? i aasked for your aadvice on how i could save my joint </p>
 <p>Well <b>i tried all sorts of method</b> including special joint exercises, joint exercises, injctions strong medications serums,ointment,handbaths,e.t.c.ITS ALL A BUNCH OF CRAP. Nothing helps. Its useless </p>

  </section>
<h3>I went to the doctors, but it was so useless...</h3>
 <p>One day, while browsing blogs on the Internet, I came across a short post written by a rheumatologist from New York on one of the medical forums. It said that often attempts to defeat arthritis, osteoarthritis and other joint problems are ineffective because we focus on the consequences of the disease but not on its root cause</p>
<p>i was devastated. I literally began to hate myself, my hands and my life, and every time I looked at them or noticed them in pictures, I was more frustrated. </p>

<p><b>I just couldn't accept the fact that I was going to have to give up</b> and accept the fact that my arms were now going to look like this for the rest of my life. And it would only get worse as time went on.....</p>

<p>Thinking about how to stop the constant pain and get my hands back to their former beauty and health, I started searching the Internet for different ways to fight this problem</p>
  <!-- Problem Details -->
  <section id="problem">
    <h3>Help for arthritis & joint pain has finally been found!?</h3>
    <p>Arthritis is inflammation of the joints that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness. 
    It can affect anyone but is most common in older adults, athletes, and individuals with genetic predisposition.</p>

    <p>The two most common types are osteoarthritis (wear-and-tear) and rheumatoid arthritis (autoimmune). 
    Left untreated, arthritis can severely restrict movement and lead to permanent joint damage.</p>

  <!-- Mistakes to Avoid -->
  <section id="mistakes">
    <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
    <p><strong>1st Mistake:</strong> Ignoring Early Symptoms.</p>
    <p>Many believe joint aches are "normal aging" and delay treatment. Early intervention can reverse damage and restore mobility.</p>

    <p><strong>2nd Mistake:</strong> Relying Only on Painkillers.</p>
    <p>While medications relieve symptoms, they don't treat the root inflammation causing arthritis. Long-term reliance on painkillers can also cause side effects like ulcers and liver damage.</p>
